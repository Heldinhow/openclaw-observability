# Specification Quality Checklist: Session Details View

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Edge cases are identified (empty state, loading states, no match filters)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (session observability dashboard)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (list, filter, view details, refresh)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes
